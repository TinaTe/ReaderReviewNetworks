Cluster 11 is the biggest Romance-dominated cluster, containing only one review of a different genre (Mystery) and almost 30 percent of all Romance reviews in the network (10). Within the clusters discussed here, it is only connected to the second Romance cluster (12).

Regarding the absorption dimensions of this cluster, there is a clear dominance of Emotional Engagement followed by Impact and Attention. This has also been observed in the preliminary analysis, although the discrepancy between Emotional Engagement and Impact is significantly larger in this cluster than in the entirety of the genre. Additionally, there is a relatively high amount of Mental imagery. In the fine-grained annotation, we see that Emotional Engagement is mostly expressed through Parasocial Response, Sympathy, Emotional Connection, Empathy and Compassion for story events. Impact is mostly observed as Addiction, followed by Anticipation Book Series and Lingering Story Feelings. The most frequently used tag for Attention is Anticipation and Realness for Mental Imagery.

As genre descriptors we find “romance” and “ya” (Young Adult), which suggests overlaps of these genres in the cluster. Unlike the other clusters, the genre description “romance” is not as distinctive for this cluster as can be seen in the keyness graph. On the one hand, this seems surprising since just like “Mystery”, “Romance” is not only a genre denominator but also the key concept underlying the storylines of this cluster. On the other hand, because the concept of romance is a common one in literature regardless of the genre and because this cluster doesn’t encompass all of the Romance reviews in the network, the term might be quite common throughout the whole corpus. Furthermore, reviewers often describe the books as “love stories”, which could be an expression that fits better into the informal style most of the reviews deploy. This can be seen in the frequent use of capital letters to emphasize words as well as descriptions of bodily reactions inside of asterisks: “I LOVE DEAN HOLDER. I WANT HIM, I NEED HIM...\*exhales the breath I was holding the entire time and sighs*. And most of all, I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK...plain and simple.” (Hopeless781140). Other evidence on the rather informal language are the comments on the reviewers’ own words – “I wasn't especially fond of [...] her damn stubbornness [...] (right Becca, says the girl who is the epitome of stubborn)” (PlayWithMe796976) – direct addressment of the author often by their first name – “Oh, Penelope, where do I start?” (BeautyAndTheMu764001) – and the frequently used slang like “OMG”, “LOL” or seemingly specific to the community: “insta-love”.

The highest rated term for this cluster is “man”/”men”. It appears 26 times in the cluster, with only ten of these occurrences describing the characters discussed. The rest can be found in general discussions of men, comparing them to the men in their lives: “Men like my father and my uncles. Men I loved with all my heart. Men like Deuce.” (Undeniable759679); “Once again, why haven't I met men like him? Oh right, they only exist in books as far as I am concerned.” (PlayWithMe796976).  This would suggest that Romance readers are mostly straight women. The female protagonists of the books are equally often discussed as their male counterparts. Nonetheless, they are more often seen as points of identification and adoration while men are rather discussed as objects of desire: “I loved them both equally and individually (I loved Echo and was IN LOVE with Noah).” (PushingTheLimi772578).

This is also reflected in the usage of the second strongest keyword “love”. It is more often directly used for the male main character rather than the female protagonist, while the focus lies less on the person themselves than their admirable qualities like strength. In total, the word “love” appears 81 times in this cluster, 24 times in relation to characters, twelve in relation to the novel or specific parts of the story, three regarding the author, 21 to describe the content or in citations, four to denote the genre and ten in relation to the reading experience. Moreover, it is exclusively used in the Romance reviews of this cluster.

Regarding the keywords that represent the content of the stories reviewed, a similar observation can be made as the one regarding the discussion of the Mystery cluster. One could yet again argue that novels in this cluster do not touch on themes outside the readers’ reality and that therefore, only a few of the keywords can be tied to specific stories; however, it must be noted that only one of the reviews gives a proper plot description. The rest of the reviews only mention themes that are dealt with in the novel. For example, “brother” and “loss” point to the plots of Beauty and the Mustache and Pushing the Limits, but readers mostly seem to highlight that to share their own experiences: “As someone who just experienced a loss in my family, I can relate to all of this, which only made me cry more.” (BeautyAndTheMu764001); “the most prominent to his story is being separated from his two little brothers who are in foster care. Although nothing like this has happened to me personally I have a family member who has and so I know how messy, emotional, and complicated that whole situation is for everybody involved.” (PushingTheLimi755149)
In other instances, they share their reactions and further characterize the protagonists: “I felt so angry and frustrated at the cards he had been dealt over and over again. The unfairness and devastating losses he faced were so cruel I could feel the anger and inability to trust that he had come to accept as normal.” (PushingTheLimi772578).

Alternatively, they point to things they particularly enjoyed: “And the love he has for his brothers is the CUTEST damn thing I've read about in a while!” (PushingTheLimi784911) This is also showcased by the frequent use of quotes and the keyword “how”, which often combined with the phrase “I love”: “I love, oh how I love, how ‘no kissing’ can turn out to be the most sensual, most intoxicating and the most sexiest scene you will ever read about.” (Hopeless781140) Instead of modeling their texts on professional reviews, which give a plot descriptions and evaluations to recommend the book/novel, the reviewers, which are studied here, seem to assume that they address an audience who have also already read it, sharing their experience and favorite parts without any context: “I laughed, I cried (a lot) and I laughed until I cried many places but the raccoon was the best!” (BeautyAndTheMu967822) Rather than the plot, readers seem to put more emphasis on the characters: “strong”, “smart” and “vulnerable” are frequently used to describe the characters and their bond, except for Beauty and the Mustache, where “smart” is often used because it apparently addresses quite complex themes: “I like that I always learn something educational in these books but I did not have to Google as much in this one.” (BeautyAndTheMu967822) This is also expressed by the frequent usage of “love” with regard to characters, but also by the relative pronoun “who”, whose prominence in the cluster points to the dominance of personal descriptions. The same goes for the determiner “each”, whichmostly appears with “other”, showing the emphasis on the relationships depicted. Therefore, while it does stand out in tone, it is no surprise that the only review not describing a book from the Romance genre completely confines itself to praising the female protagonist and the real-life connection between reviewer and book.

Apart from that, as can be derived from the rather strong keyword “incredible”, for reviewers from this cluster reading is perceived as a very intense experience. This is further backed by the term “experience” itself, which functions as one of the keywords. “HOPELESS is a story you all need to live and experience yourself. You need to BREATHE it in and let it run through your veins until it's embedded in your soul.” (Hopeless781140) This deeply embodied notion of reading is also reflected in the keywords “heart”, “cry” and “tear” as well as in the usage of “love” to express the kind of reading experience they undergo: “Their story made me laugh, cry, squee and swoon, and I loved every single freaking minute of it!!!” (Hopeless794091). Notably, these experiences seem to lean more towards negative emotions, which, paradoxically, do promote a certain amount of pleasure: “This book will tear out your heart, shatter it into the tiniest little pieces and then slowly repair itself, one piece at a time. It is breathtakingly stunning and beautifully torturous.” (Hopeless781140)

As already mentioned, some readers share some of the negative experiences described in the books, which seems to further their enjoyment into an impactful positive experience: “Although my experiences are vastly different to the characters in this book the feelings behind them weren’t all that different at all and so I connected with Noah and Echo in a rare and special way. [...] My emotions were totally invested in this book and so I really connected with it and can see it holding a special place in my heart for years to come.” (PushingTheLimi755149)
This pathos-laden component is accompanied by positive feelings towards the relationships, as indicated by the instances where readers talk about the love they share or the keyword “perfect”: “The plot was a perfect balance of an intense love story and a heartbreaking story of tragic loss & forgiveness.” (PushingTheLimi772578). This also applies to the sexual tension most readers positively report on as implied by the keyword “hot”, which is not at all perceived as incongruous to the more serious aspects of the story: “And WOW, Katie McGarry sure knows how to create some seriously HOT intimate moments. \*Fans self* Their romance just felt right - two emotionally and physically scarred people who come together with a mutual understanding and the ability to heal each other's wounds.” (PushingTheLimi784911)
