Cluster 11 is the biggest Romance-dominated cluster, containing only one review of a different genre (Mystery) and almost 30 percent of all Romance reviews in the network (10). Within the clusters discussed here, it is only connected to the second Romance cluster (12).

Regarding the absorption dimensions of this cluster, there is a clear dominance of Emotional Engagement followed by Impact and Attention. This has also been observed in the preliminary analysis, although the discrepancy between Emotional Engagement and Impact is significantly larger in this cluster than in the entirety of the genre. Additionally, there is a relatively high amount of Mental imagery. In the fine-grained annotation, we see that Emotional Engagement is mostly expressed through Parasocial Response, Sympathy, Emotional Connection, Empathy and Compassion for story events. Impact is mostly observed as Addiction, followed by Anticipation Book Series and Lingering Story Feelings. The most frequently used tag for Attention is Anticipation and Realness for Mental Imagery.

As genre descriptors we find “romance” and “ya” (Young Adult), which suggests overlaps of these genres in the cluster. Unlike the other clusters, the genre description “romance” is not as distinctive for this cluster as can be seen in the keyness graph. On the one hand, this seems surprising since just like “Mystery”, “Romance” is not only a genre denominator but also the key concept underlying the storylines of this cluster. On the other hand, because the concept of romance is a common one in literature regardless of the genre and because this cluster doesn’t encompass all of the Romance reviews in the network, the term might be quite common throughout the whole corpus. Furthermore, reviewers often describe the books as “love stories”, which could be an expression that fits better into the informal style most of the reviews deploy. This can be seen in the frequent use of capital letters to emphasize words as well as descriptions of bodily reactions inside of asterisks: “I LOVE DEAN HOLDER. I WANT HIM, I NEED HIM...\*exhales the breath I was holding the entire time and sighs*. And most of all, I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK...plain and simple.” (Hopeless781140). Other evidence on the rather informal language are the comments on the reviewers’ own words – “I wasn't especially fond of [...] her damn stubbornness [...] (right Becca, says the girl who is the epitome of stubborn)” (PlayWithMe796976) – direct addressment of the author often by their first name – “Oh, Penelope, where do I start?” (BeautyAndTheMu764001) – and the frequently used slang like “OMG”, “LOL” or seemingly specific to the community: “insta-love”.

The highest rated term for this cluster is “man”/”men”. It appears 26 times in the cluster, with only ten of these occurrences describing the characters discussed. The rest can be found in general discussions of men, comparing them to the men in their lives: “Men like my father and my uncles. Men I loved with all my heart. Men like Deuce.” (Undeniable759679); “Once again, why haven't I met men like him? Oh right, they only exist in books as far as I am concerned.” (PlayWithMe796976).  This would suggest that Romance readers are mostly straight women. The female protagonists of the books are equally often discussed as their male counterparts. Nonetheless, they are more often seen as points of identification and adoration while men are rather discussed as objects of desire: “I loved them both equally and individually (I loved Echo and was IN LOVE with Noah).” (PushingTheLimi772578). This is also reflected in the usage of the second strongest keyword “love”. It is more often directly used for the male main character rather than the female protagonist, while the focus lies less on the person themselves than their admirable qualities like strength. In total, the word “love” appears 81 times in this cluster, 24 times in relation to characters, twelve in relation to the novel or specific parts of the story, three regarding the author, 21 to describe the content or in citations, four to denote the genre and ten in relation to the reading experience (see Table 17 in appendix). Moreover, it is exclusively used in the Romance reviews of this cluster.
