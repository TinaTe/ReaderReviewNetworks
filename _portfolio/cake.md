Cluster 12 is the second Romance cluster containing eight reviews, six of which belong to the Romance genre (18 percent of all Romance reviews in the network) and two Science Fiction reviews (eight percent of all Science Fiction reviews). It is strongly tied to the other Romance cluster (11) and has a connection to the Horror/Thriller Science Fiction cluster (08). It can be noted that the direct connection is located between two science fiction nodes, which seem to be a more incidental match to the cluster as they are quite short.
Regarding the Absorption Dimensions, Attention, Emotional Engagement and Impact score the highest, the latter being slightly more represented than the two former. This is quite astonishing given the distribution of the genre in general. The Science Fiction reviews do not contain Emotional Engagement. But while they are mainly responsible for the rise of Impact above Emotional Engagement and contributing to the Attention count, even without this influence the ratio between Emotional Engagement and Attention does not align with the general Distribution in the genre.
In the fine-grained annotation, there is a peak in Lingering Story Feelings in Impact, followed by General Sense of Absorption and Inability to stop reading in Attention and Parasocial Response and Emotional Connection in Emotional Engagement. Significantly, while Romance is the genre with the highest density of annotations, there is a vast difference between the annotation count of this cluster (29) and the other Romance cluster (11 ,65 annotations). After considering the difference in number of reviews and the inclusion of reviews from different genres, this still leaves us with 6.5 annotations per review in cluster 11 and only 4.8 in cluster 12. This is also reflected in the keywords where we find unique content words that point to plot descriptions, which can be found in approximately half of the reviews, but only one keyword describing reading experience (“love”).

The reviews are very similar in style to those in cluster 11, employing the same informal language, capitalization, reaction descriptions in asterisks, commentary, slang and directly addressing the author, often by first name, while frequently adding “please” as found in the keywords.
What separates this cluster from other clusters that show a clear dominance in one genre is that no genre description appears in the keywords. Although “love” is among them, it is not mentioned in terms of genre (“love story”) and is not as defining for this cluster as it is in Cluster 11. In this cluster the term appears 38 times, seven times in regard to the characters, 13 times to express adoration for the book or parts of the story, once in regard to the author, 13 times to describe the content and once in relation to reading experience. By analogy to cluster 11, it is exclusively used by readers of the Romance genre and used more often in relation to the male than the female protagonists. In contrast to the other cluster, “love” serves less in the context of   character descriptions and only in one case as a depiction of experience.
The most frequent function for “love" in this cluster is to express readers’ affective attitude towards the novel and to describe its content. This reflects the fact that the connection to the characters tends to remain on a superficial surface level even though they play an important role in these reviews. This may be due to the fact that the romance novels in this cluster seem to correspond more to the genre of romantic comedies, as is also indicated in the keywords “funny”, “romantic”, "perfect", "adorable", "wonderful" and "sweet".[^1]  Another reason might be that readers in this cluster do not actually share the experiences that are depicted, but rather perceive them as a necessity to an engaging plot: “I like the awareness the writer sends here regarding domestic violence, an often element inserted in book with a certain purpose” (Collide775077); “I loved the humor and the fun but there was an undercurrent of emotion happening too and it was the prefect mix” (RoyallyMatched872433); “But those mistakes made for great drama that really helped create this full, heartfelt story.” (Sustained792596)
This is also underlined by the fact that “I” is the term deemed most unlikely to appear in this cluster, which – given a representation of 10.5 times per review in this cluster versus 17.8 times in cluster 11 – could be a marker of less self implication in writing the reviews.

[^1]: Except for “horrible”, which is in few instances used to describe the feelings of one character in regard to the prospect of becoming king and leaving behind his carefree life but is only addressed briefly: “But now that he's the future king, he knows exactly how horrible that life can be. He has so much political stuff to learn - and he hates that.” (RoyallyMatched818332)
