Cluster 12 is the second Romance cluster containing eight reviews, six of which belong to the Romance genre (18 percent of all Romance reviews in the network) and two Science Fiction reviews (eight percent of all Science Fiction reviews). It is strongly tied to the other Romance cluster (11) and has a connection to the Horror/Thriller Science Fiction cluster (08). It can be noted that the direct connection is located between two science fiction nodes, which seem to be a more incidental match to the cluster as they are quite short.
Regarding the Absorption Dimensions, Attention, Emotional Engagement and Impact score the highest, the latter being slightly more represented than the two former. This is quite astonishing given the distribution of the genre in general. The Science Fiction reviews do not contain Emotional Engagement. But while they are mainly responsible for the rise of Impact above Emotional Engagement and contributing to the Attention count, even without this influence the ratio between Emotional Engagement and Attention does not align with the general Distribution in the genre.
In the fine-grained annotation, there is a peak in Lingering Story Feelings in Impact, followed by General Sense of Absorption and Inability to stop reading in Attention and Parasocial Response and Emotional Connection in Emotional Engagement. Significantly, while Romance is the genre with the highest density of annotations, there is a vast difference between the annotation count of this cluster (29) and the other Romance cluster (11 ,65 annotations). After considering the difference in number of reviews and the inclusion of reviews from different genres, this still leaves us with 6.5 annotations per review in cluster 11 and only 4.8 in cluster 12. This is also reflected in the keywords where we find unique content words that point to plot descriptions, which can be found in approximately half of the reviews, but only one keyword describing reading experience (“love”).
